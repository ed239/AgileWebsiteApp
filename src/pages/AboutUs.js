                        <p>Easy E-Learning is a boutique consulting firm with decades of software development experience. We grew  up in the era of structured design methodologies, adapted 
                        our learnings to the rapid development  approaches, and graduated to Agile. Having partnered with many of the original Agile founders,
                         we worked hand-in-hand with them  to implement Agile software development practices at companies like IBM, Lotus and Verizon.  Raj Heda, 
                         President and CEO of Easy E-Learning, is a leading author, teacher and world-renowned industry  consultant. Our in-house experts are master’s degree 
                         students at Boston University’s  Metropolitan College, with decades of industry experience.</p>
