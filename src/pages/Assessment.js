<<<<<<< Updated upstream
                <p>The effectiveness of Agiledevelopment efforts will be either magnified or diminished by your  organization‚Äôs leaders. The Apex leadership assessment quantitativelyassesses the skills and  capabilities of your leadershipteam. As outlined in the Agile Manifesto, the following principles  are of paramount importance to leaders. First, producing value: doesleadership recognize that  the production of value over theproduction of features? Second, encouraging change: does  leadership not only welcome change, and not only encourage change, butactually reward  change? And third, deliverfrequently: does leadership guide the organization to processes  conducive to continuous improvement and delivery? Apex‚Äôs leadershipassessment  comprehensively surveys leadershipskill in your organization, and it produces recommendations  to get leadership on the right track toagility.</p>
                <li className='ass-titles'>Organization Assessment</li>
                <p>As important as Agile is to your software developmentteams, many of the same principles apply  to your organization. The ApexOrganization Assessment will measure your current capabilities  as an Agile organization. We will identify those areas where you are onthe right track as well as  those where you are followingpractices that are counterproductive. Like a tried and true family  recipe, we have distilled our decades of experience in the softwareindustry to create a  comprehensive assessment ofsoftware development practices. Among others metrics, we assess  the following key capabilities: value: do each your product releasesproduce recognizable and  useful value for the customer;openness to change: are your organizations receptive and  encouraging of changing requirements, both early and late in the productcycle; and frequent  deliveriesvia a continuous improvement and delivery pipeline.</p>
                <li className='ass-titles'>Portfolio Assessment</li>
                <p>Rarely does a company producea single product or feature that is divorced from other  cooperating products. In an organization with multiple and simultaneousdevelopment efforts, a  siloed approach to productdevelopment becomes counterproductive. Do your product teams  operate independently or is there a cooperative spirit aligning yourgoals? Is progress gated by  milestones and measured by thenumber of tasks completed? Many of the same techniques you  apply to iterative software development also apply to portfoliomanagement. Our portfolio  assessment ascertains where yousit on an Agile spectrum and more importantly, what practices  can you adopt that will bring value, openness to change, and improveddelivery to your product  portfolio.</p>
                <li className='ass-titles'>Program Assessment</li>
                <p>The Apex program assessmentevaluates how well your program development strategy aligns  with your product portfolio. In an organization with multiplesimultaneous development streams,  cooperation and good intentions alone will not produce intended results.Apex measures the  engagement of program stakeholdersand analyzes strategies for predictability and problem  resolution.

The Apexprogram assessment measures the propensity of your program to  exist cooperatively within the portfolio anddeliver value while being open to change.</p>
                <li className='ass-titles'>Team Assessment</li>
                <p>There are two important considerations. First, there is no perfect team environment. Second,  creating an environment where teams can thrive takes a lot of work. TheApex Team Assessment  looks at the makeup and dynamicsof an individual agile team. We ascertain to what degree has  the team jelled or what obstacles may be preventing that from occurring.We look at the team  dynamics: how much trust is therebetween team members? Is there a team culture, and if so, is  the culture beneficial to, or detrimental to, the team‚Äôs success? Doesthe team feel empowered to  deliver great products? Apex‚Äôsdecades of experience in Agile organizations allows us to  recognize and assess those aspects of teamwork that encourage producingvalue, being open to  change, andallow for continuous improvement and delivery.</p>
                <li className='ass-titles'>Individual Role/ Talent</li>
